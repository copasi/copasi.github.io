### sbmodelr - New modeling tool to create complex models
 
The COPASI team is happy to announce a new tool, called [*sbmodelr*](https://github.com/copasi/sbmodelr?tab=readme-ov-file#sbmodelr---a-tool-to-replicate-a-copasisbml-model-into-a-set-of-replicas), which is intended to construct large models that are composed of repeating units. Essentially, you start with a base model and then tell *sbmodelr* to create a number of repeat units of that model, as well as which model entities interact between units.

*sbmodelr* is a python-based command line utility that reads a systems biology model, encoded in COPASI or SBML formats, to create a new model that is composed of several connected units that are replicates of the base model. These units may be organized as an arbitrarily connected network, a 2D rectangular grid, or a 3D cuboid array. Each unit contains a complete copy of the original model with all its species, reactions, compartments, events, and global quantities.

The new model can be a composition of the base according to:
 - a 2D rectangular matrix of base units
 - a 3D cuboid array of base units
 - a number of units connected through an arbitrary network

Interactions between units in the new model can be:

 - species being transported between units
 - species acting as inhibitors/activators of the synthesis of other species (to make gene regulatory networks)
 - diffusive coupling of explicit ODEs ("rate rules" in SBML)
 - coupling of explicit ODEs through chemical synapse terms, appropriate for models representing membrane potentials

Practical uses of sbmodelr include:

 - using a cell model to create a model of a tissue or organoid,
 - use a gene transcription model to create a gene regulatory network
 - use a neuron model (e.g. the Hodgkin-Huxley) to create a network of neurons

*sbmodelr* was written by Pedro Mendes in Python on top of [basiCO](https://basico.readthedocs.io/). It is available immediately for installation using pypi (`pip install sbmodelr`). It is free and open source software under the Artistic License 2.0.
