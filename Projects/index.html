<h1> Projects </h1>
<p>Here we list of complementary software projects to COPASI that have been written by members of our team. This includes two APIs for scripting languages, a tool for model composition and instructions for a particular approach to parameter estimation.</p>
<h2 name="Table_of_Contents_">Currently maintained software:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b><a title="basiCO: A simplified python interface to COPASI" target="_blank" href="https://basico.readthedocs.io/"> basiCO: A simplified python interface to COPASI</a></b>. This is the preferred way to interface COPASI with Python programs as it provides a high level interface. Several software are now using basiCO. The link above is to the online documentation, the code repository is <a title="basiCO code repository" target="_blank"  href="https://github.com/copasi/basico" >here</a> and this software is now described in a peer review publication: <a title="basiCO publication" target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.05553">Bergmann FT (2023) "BASICO: A simplified Python interface to COPASI" J Open Source Softw. 8:5553</a>.</li>

  <li><b><a title="CoRC: the COPASI R Connector" target="_blank" href="https://jpahle.github.io/CoRC/index.html"> CoRC: the COPASI R Connector</a></b>. This is the preferred way to interface COPASI with programs written in the statistical language R. The link above is to the online documentation, the code repository is <a  title="CoRC code repository" target="_blank"  href="https://github.com/jpahle/CoRC/">here</a> and this software is described in a peer reviewed piblication: <a title="CoRC publication" target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btab033">Förster J, Bergmann FT, Pahle J (2021) "CoRC - the COPASI R Connector" Bioinformatics 37:2778–2779</a>.</li>

  <li><b><a href="https://github.com/copasi/sbmodelr?tab=readme-ov-file#sbmodelr---a-tool-to-replicate-a-copasisbml-model-into-a-set-of-replicas">sbmodelr - a tool to replicate a COPASI/SBML model into a set of replicas</a></b>. This is a python-based command line utility that reads a COPASI or SBML model to create a new model that is composed of several replicas of the original model. These base units may be organized as an arbitrarily connected network, a 2D rectangular grid, or a 3D cuboid array. Each unit contains a complete copy of the original model with all its species, reactions, compartments, events, and global quantities. This tool is useful to construct models of tissues based on a cell model, gene regulatory networks based on a single gene transcription model, and spiking neuronal networks based on a model of a single neuron, among other uses. The link above is the the online documentation, the code repository is <a title="sbmodelr code repository" target="_blank"  href="https://github.com/copasi/sbmodelr">here</a>.

  <li> <a title="COPASI: Projects/Piecewise parameter fitting" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Projects/piecewise_parameter_fitting/" > Piecewise parameter fitting with COPASI</a>. This is a strategy for piecewise parameter estimation in COPASI, particularly useful for stochastic models. The page describes examples of applying this method, which was originally described in this paper: <a target="_blank"  href="https://doi.org/10.4172/jcsb.1000095">Zimmer C (2012) "Parameter Estimation for Stochastic Models of Biochemical Reactions" J. Comp. Sci. Sys. Biol. 06:1.</a> and the COPASI implementation in this one: <a  target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btv759">Bergmann FT, Sahle S, Zimmer C (2016) "Piecewise parameter estimation for stochastic models in COPASI" Bioinformatics 32:1586–1588</a>
