    <h4>Bug Fixes and Enhancements since COPASI 4.44 (Build 295)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li> Graphical User Interface (CopasiUI)
        <ul>
          <li>
            Optimization and Parameter Estimation: Whether to display the population dynamics is now part of the problem specification.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed deletion of plots in the plot overview.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed issue where event targets where not longer added to plots, reports, and time series.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed crash occurring when switching the plot engine to: Qt DataVizualization (surface) for non surface plots.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved labels for surface plots which where limited to 2 decimal digits.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed problem with notes of global quantities occurring when copying. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Time course Method Hybrid (RK-45): Selecting the partitioning strategy: user defined and selecting the deterministic reactions caused a crash.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed delay during start on some Windows 11 installations caused while saving the known MIRIAM resources.
          </li>
          <li>
            Functions: It is not longer permitted to copy mass action kinetics.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed crash occurring when repeatedly deleting parameter sets.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fixed problem deleting multiple global quantities.
          </li>

          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> Command Line (CopasiSE)  
        <ul>
          <li>
            The argument to the option <code>--report-file</code> is now taken relative to the current working directory.
          </li>
          <li>
            Steady-State: Added warning message indicating that no steady-state was found.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> Simulation Engine
        <ul>

          </li>
          <li>
            Steady-State: Fixed occasionally occurring problem calculating the target criterions for models containing moieties, which lead to not finding a steady-state.
